# Changing some things up

I've decided to change freekrai.net a little bit, for years it's been mostly a marketing-type site, and I've made the decision to switch it to more of a content site.

I'm in the process of making some positive changes to my life, that started a few months ago, and has continued.

I've got a good job, a happy family, and I get to travel for conferences and teach other people how to do cool things related to DevOps, Node.js, real-time APIs, remote working and just whatever else I think of.

Freekrai.net has been around for nearly 15 years, and it's been through a lot of changes, I'm not entirely done just yet with the end project, but it's getting there so stay tuned.
