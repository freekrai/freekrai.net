# Jaded

This site is powered by [Jaded:](https://github.com/freekrai/jaded), my static(ish) site generator.

I'm actually working on a new version of Jaded, that will allow you to generate static files rather than the current in-memory process that's used.

Jaded works well, it has a folder for posts, and a folder for views which are all using the Jade template language, and yes, I'm aware Jade is now called Pug, but _Pugged_ does not sound anywhere near as nice as _Jaded_, and so I will continue to call this system Jaded and continue to use Jade.

I built this system a while ago because:

1. I wanted to.
2. I wanted to redo my personal page and make it differently.
3. I felt like it.

It's been running on version 1 of Jaded for over a year and handles well, and the new features coming soon will make Jaded handle even nicer.
