# Speaking

I’m available for speaking gigs; just [contact me](http://rogerstringer.com/contact/ "Contact Me"). I’m open to talk about anything Internet-related, but I have the most fun talking about back-end development, PHP, Node.js, real-time, Twilio, WordPress, APIs, Remote work, being a startup founder and Agile project management.

### Upcoming Engagements

#### [Future Insights Live](https://futureinsightslive.com/las-vegas-2015/), June 2015, Las Vegas, NV, USA

I’ll be hosting an all day workshop called **Build Your Own Real-time REST API**:

> This workshop is aimed at both developers who want to learn to build Real-time REST APIs and designers who want to get first-hand knowledge of integrating APIs into their frontend client-side projects
> 
> What you’ll learn
> 
> - Planning and Building an API
> - Talking to an API via client libraries
> - Build an app that lets users login and post news stories

I’ll also be hosting a talk on day two called **Building Your Own Real-time API**.

> The days of complex backend systems are at an end, developers can build complex apps now without the time it takes to devote to a full backend system thanks to APIs.
> 
> In this talk, developers will get introduced to using LevelDB, Node.JS and Socket.io to build a real-time REST API that can be integrated into any any client-side app quickly. Once built, developers can use this API for apps of all sizes and platforms without any extra work.
